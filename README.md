# Fusion-Insider-threat-detection
## Dataset
The Dataset used in this work is [CMU-CERT Dataset (versions R-4.2) ](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=508099)[[1]](#1), [[2]](#2). And we use the data preprocessing method of paper [[3]](#3).

## Code runtime environment
* Run the program using ```jupyter notebook```.
## Parameter Setting

* Modify the path of the ```trainData``` and replace it with your own dataset.

* Specify in the ```LISANCOLUMNS``` which column the user attributes and department attributes are in.

* Specify in the ```LABELCOLUMNS``` which column is the label column.

* Choose the algorithm you need in the ```MODELNAME```, there are Autoencoder and Isolation Forest available.

* ```HIDDEN_NEURONS``` represents the number of neurons per layer in the AE algorithm.
* ```K``` and ```L``` are as described in the original paper.
